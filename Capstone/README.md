## Capstone
#### Overview
This project is based around my keen interest in machine learning models for retail and ecommerce. The central ingredient for any retail related machine learning algorithm is a good Customer Ralationship Management (CRM) software and related database. 
From this, I had several ideas for models that can be created from a good customer database:

###### Starting Point: Customer Segmentation
1. Recommendation Engine
2. Predicting Trends : Sales Forecasting for Inventory Purchase
3. Targeted Marketing
4. Promotional Optimisation
5. Store Allocation (logistical process optimisation)

I decided to try to create a recommendation engine as they can have a great impact on sales and profit margins when implemented properly. They also can be created very easily but can range from very simple to extremely complex.

This is a work in progress - reach out if you're interested to know more, or if you have suggestions for data to incorporate.

## Current Progress

#### Data Collection
 Within the retail industry, customer sales data is a highly valued commodity so it is extremely difficult to come across datasets with enough customer and product information to be able to create this kind of product.
 The dataset I have chosen [here](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

#### EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis
