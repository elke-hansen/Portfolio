# Portfolio
My portfolio showcasing ongoing Data Science Projects

During my time at General Assembly I worked on the following projects to showcase my skills and understanding of python, statistics, and machine learning and the practical application of data science. These projects start from basic coding problems through EDA and visualisation, all the way to full scale start to finish problem definition and solving. These were all completed over a 12 week period, and while they are not all perfect, they are an accurate representation of my progress in learning from week 1 to week 12.

For each project there is atleast one jupyter notebook containing all the code, any relevant data files, a slide deck used for presenting the outcomes of the project and readme file explaining the project and expectations.
